Capture file: anomaly1.pcap
Implementation:
  minquic, commit ???????
Endpoints:
  - 10.0.0.1: server
  - 10.0.0.2: client
Issue:
  Client sends ack-only packet in response to an ack-only packet.
  That is the packet does not ack any packet with data that is not
  previously acked. The number of ack-only packets from client is three,
  while server has sent only two packets with data.

  This is a violation of the following section of the version 9 draft:

   8.16.2.  Sending ACK Frames

   ... Implementations MUST NOT send more than one ACK frame per received
   packet that contains frames other than ACK frames. ...

Issue:
   Server treats the case of off bit being false in stream frame of
   initial packet as an error, but it isn't clear that this violates the
   specification. Need to check this.

Issue:
  When given a large jump in packet numbers, the minquic server counts down
  from the received packet number, printing log messages, spending time
  proportional to the gap in the packet numbers. Minquic seems to assume that
  the client will simply increment packet numbers.
