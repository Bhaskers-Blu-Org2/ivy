Capture file: anomaly1.pcap
Implementation:
  minquic, commit ???????
Endpoints:
  - 10.0.0.1: server
  - 10.0.0.2: client
Issue:
  Client sends ack-only packet in response to an ack-only packet.
  That is the packet does not ack any packet with data that is not
  previously acked. The number of ack-only packets from client is three,
  while server has sent only two packets with data.

  This is a violation of the following section of the version 9 draft:

   8.16.2.  Sending ACK Frames

   ... Implementations MUST NOT send more than one ACK frame per received
   packet that contains frames other than ACK frames. ...


Capture file: picoquic.pcap
Implementation:
  picoquic
Endpoints:
  - 10.0.0.1: server
  - 10.0.0.2: client
Issue:
  Regarding the retry token, The specification, draft 14 states:

    The Initial packet has two additional header fields that follow the
    normal Long Header.

  However, picoquic is putting these fields in the middle of the long header,
  before the length and the packet number fields.
