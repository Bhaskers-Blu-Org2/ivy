Capture file: anomaly1.pcap
Implementation:
  minquic, commit ???????
Endpoints:
  - 10.0.0.1: server
  - 10.0.0.2: client
Issue:
  Client sends ack-only packet in response to an ack-only packet.
  That is the packet does not ack any packet with data that is not
  previously acked. The number of ack-only packets from client is three,
  while server has sent only two packets with data.

  This is a violation of the following section of the version 9 draft:

   8.16.2.  Sending ACK Frames

   ... Implementations MUST NOT send more than one ACK frame per received
   packet that contains frames other than ACK frames. ...

Issue:
   Server treats the case of off bit being false in stream frame of
   initial packet as an error, but it isn't clear that this violates the
   specification. Need to check this.

Ivy commit:
  39a6f6f
Issue:
  When given a large jump in packet numbers, the minquic server counts down
  from the received packet number, printing log messages, spending time
  proportional to the gap in the packet numbers. Minquic seems to assume that
  the client will simply increment packet numbers.

Implementation:
  picoquic
Endpoints:
  - 10.0.0.1: server
  - 10.0.0.2: client
Issue:
  Regarding the retry token, The specification, draft 14 states:

    The Initial packet has two additional header fields that follow the
    normal Long Header.

  However, picoquic is putting these fields in the middle of the long header,
  before the length and the packet number fields.


Event file:  anomaly6.iev
Picoquic log file: anomaly6.log
QUIC version: draft 14
Ivy commit: 7bcdf6a
Implementation:
  picoquic
Issue:
  Client sends a MAX_STREAM_ID frame with stream id 0, which is a client, not
  a server stream id. Server (picoquicdemo) responds with connection close and
  error code of STREAM_ID_ERROR. However, specification does not state that it
  is an error to send a stream id that is not an id of the peer, and does not
  state that STREAM_ID_ERROR should be returned in this case.
