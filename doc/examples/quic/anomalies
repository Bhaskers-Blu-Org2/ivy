Capture file: anomaly1.pcap
Implementation:
  minquic, commit ???????
Endpoints:
  - 10.0.0.1: server
  - 10.0.0.2: client
Issue:
  Client sends ack-only packet in response to an ack-only packet.
  That is the packet does not ack any packet with data that is not
  previously acked. The number of ack-only packets from client is three,
  while server has sent only two packets with data.
