These are the source files for the 8 proofs described in the paper:

K. L. McMillan, "Eager Abstraction for Symbolic Model Checking", CAV 2018.

To run these examples, in addition to Ivy, you need to install the ABC
model checker, which is available here:

https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm

The version of ABC used in the paper is b119cf5edf63. The command abc
must be in your executable path.

File names of the form *_mc.ivy are the model checking proofs and file
names of the form *_inv.ivy are the corresponding invariant checking
proofs.

Run the files with the command ivy_check, like this:

ivy_check filename.ivy
