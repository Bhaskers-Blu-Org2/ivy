title: Hello, world!

Having specified and verified a protocol or two, it's natural to want
to try actually running a verified protocol. Ivy programs can be
compiled into the C++ language and executed in various ways.

The simplest way to try out an Ivy program is to generate a
read-eval-print loop (REPL). We'll start with the closest thing we can
write to the "Hello, World!" program in Ivy. Ivy programs are
*reactive*, meaning that they ony do something when called upon by
their environment.  This means we can't actually write a program that
spontaneously prints a message. Here is an approximation:

    #lang ivy1.6

    action world

    action hello = {
        call world
    }

    export hello
    import word
    
This program provides an action `hello` that calls action `world`
provided by the environment. Let's try compiling and running this program:

    $ ivy_to_cpp target=repl helloworld.ivy
    $ ls helloworld*
